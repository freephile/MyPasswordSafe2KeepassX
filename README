REQUIREMENTS
You'll need XML_Beautifier to pretty print the xml
@see http://pear.php.net/manual/en/package.xml.xml-beautifier.php

USAGE
#1 export your MyPasswordSafe to XML, saving the output as 'passwords.xml'
#2 Using the command-line interpreter for PHP ("the cli"), invoke the converter
and redirecting output to a file of your choice
e.g. php -f converter.php > converted.passwords.xml
#3 Now open KeyPassX and import the file from #2.  Save and you're done.

CONFIGURATION

 You simply need to tell the script where your password data file is 
 (the output from step #1)
